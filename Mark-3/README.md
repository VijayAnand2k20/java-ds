# Day 4 - Conditionals and Loops

## Conditional Statements


### if statements
Syntax of if statement:
```java
if (condition) {
    // code
}
```

Syntax of if-else statement:
```java
if (condition) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}
```

Syntax of if-else-if statement:
```java
if (condition) {
    // code
} else if (condition) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}
```

- The condition in the if statement must be a boolean expression. If the condition is true, the code inside the if statement will be executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the if statement will be skipped.


### Loops

Syntax of while loop:
```java
while (condition) {
    // code
}
```

Syntax of do-while loop:
```java
do {
    // code
} while (condition);
```

Syntax of for loop:
```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code
}
```

- The condition in the while loop must be a boolean expression. If the condition is true, the code inside the while loop will be executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the while loop will be skipped.

- The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, except that the condition is evaluated at the end of the loop. Therefore, the code inside the do-while loop will always be executed at least once.
